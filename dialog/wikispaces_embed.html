<p class="morgana">You must stop Owain from fighting.</p>
<p class="arthur">(annoyed - a sense that he also feels some guilt)<br />
It's his damn fault. He shouldn't have picked up the gauntlet!</p>
<p class="morgana">So put an end to it.</p>
<p class="arthur">The challenge has been taken up. The fight cannot be stopped.</p>
<p class="morgana">So fight in his place. Much as it pains me to say it, you're the man for this job, not him.</p>
<p class="arthur">I can't!</p>
<p class="morgana">Why not?</p>
<p class="arthur">Owain picked up the gauntlet, Owain is the one who must fight. That is the Knight's code. He knew that.</p>
<p class="morgana">But he's just a boy.</p>
<p class="arthur">(a heavy sigh)<br />
I know.</p>
