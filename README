== Motivation == 

Exercises that successfully promote interactivity, learner engagement, and learner control often rely on advanced technology like Java, JavaScript, or Flash that most lecturers do not have the time or the skills to master. What we propose is to identify or develop a limited number of exercise's types that rely on advanced technology but in which the content can be defined through the editing of an independent text file, without any knowledge of the technology behind the exercises (details and examples are provided in the accompanying documents). 

== Widgeds? == 

Widgeds are modules for the Exercist project.

Widged stands for a widget for education, with a widget defined as "portable chunk of code that can be installed and executed within any separate HTML-based web page by an end user without requiring additional compilation" (Wikipedia).

For now, we provide example of activities written in javascript. Look at treasure chest for an activity rewritten as a jquery plugin.Extra information still needs to be added to transform them into widged modules.

By default, unless specified otherwise, all content is under a dual MIT license and GPL license. 

As jQuery plugin: Notes, Treasure Chest, Timed Reading, Dialog, Racing Game, Content Slider.

All other widgeds are still to be converted into jQuery plugins.

Check widgeds@wikispaces for live demos: http://widgeds.wikispaces.com/

== How to Change Activity Content == 

To change the activity content go to the [activity]_assets folders.

Go to the “images” subdirectory, delete all files and replace them with your own image files.

Edit the file index.html file in any text editor. Replace the content with your own material.

Reload the web page in your browser

Note: For the demo to work, the files need to be accessed from a network connection. If you are in offline mode, edit the reference to the jQuery library to point to a local instead of a remote file ("http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.5.1/jquery.min.js" should become "libs/jquery.min.js" or something of the like)

== Criteria for inclusion of new widgeds == 

  * Quality of Content
  * Potential Effectiveness as a Teaching Tool
  * Ease of Use
