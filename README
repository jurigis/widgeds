Widgeds are modules for the Exercist project.

Widged stands for a widget for education, with a widget defined as "portable chunk of code that can be installed and executed within any separate HTML-based web page by an end user without requiring additional compilation" (Wikipedia).

For now, we provide example of activities written in javascript. They still need to be rewritten as widged modules.
