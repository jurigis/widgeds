Widgeds are modules for the Exercist project.

Widged stands for a widget for education, with a widget defined as "portable chunk of code that can be installed and executed within any separate HTML-based web page by an end user without requiring additional compilation" (Wikipedia).

For now, we provide example of activities written in javascript. Look at treasure chest for an activity rewritten as a jquery plugin.Extra information still needs to be added to transform them into widged modules.

By default, unless specified otherwise, all content is under a MIT license. 

As jQuery plugin: Notes, Treasure Chest, Timed Reading

All other widgeds are still to be converted into jQuery plugins.
