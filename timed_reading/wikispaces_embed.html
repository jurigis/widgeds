<div class="title">Learning Design</div>
<div class="content">
<p>A Learning Design describes the educational process, not just courseware but the whole teaching/learning experience. It's a more or less formal description of a pedagogical scenario (also called educational script or storyboard) and that may or may not follow an instructional design model.</p>
<p>The process of learning design refers to the activity of designing units of learning, learning activities or learning environment.</p>
<p>Learning Designs are "pedagogically informed learning activities which make effective use of appropriate tools and resources" (Gr√°inne Conole and Karen Fill, creators of the DialogPlus Toolkit.)</p>
